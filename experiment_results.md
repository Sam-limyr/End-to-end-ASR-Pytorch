Investigating performance

| Prenet | PreClassifier |CTC-WER|CTC-Loss|
|---------|-------------|-------|-----|
| MLP    | RNN|
| config  | Path to the decoding config file.|
| outdir  | Path to store decode result.|
| njobs   | Number of threads used for decoding, very important in terms of efficiency. Large value equals fast decoding yet RAM/GPU RAM expensive.    |
